# ergo-indexer-rust

A Chain Indexer and accompanying API for the Ergo blockchain.

The indexer is written in Rust for high performance while the API will be written in TypeScript. This is mostly a learning project since the feature packed [Ergo Blockchain Explorer](https://github.com/ergoplatform/explorer-backend) is already available.
